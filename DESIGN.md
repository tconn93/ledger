  How to Keep a Business Ledger with This App

  The current architecture is excellent for business ledger keeping and doesn't need changes. Here's how to use it effectively:

  The Architecture is Sound

  This application follows proper double-entry bookkeeping principles used by professional accounting systems. The architecture is correct and production-ready for small to medium businesses.

  How to Use It for Your Business

  1. Setup Your Chart of Accounts (One-time)

  The demo data includes standard accounts, but customize them for your business:

  Assets (what you own):
  - 1000 - Cash in Bank
  - 1100 - Accounts Receivable (money customers owe you)
  - 1200 - Inventory
  - 1300 - Equipment
  - 1400 - Prepaid Expenses

  Liabilities (what you owe):
  - 2000 - Accounts Payable (money you owe suppliers)
  - 2100 - Loans Payable
  - 2200 - Credit Card Payable
  - 2300 - Salaries Payable

  Equity (ownership):
  - 3000 - Owner's Capital
  - 3100 - Retained Earnings

  Revenue (income):
  - 4000 - Sales Revenue
  - 4100 - Service Revenue
  - 4200 - Interest Income

  Expenses (costs):
  - 5000 - Cost of Goods Sold
  - 6000 - Rent Expense
  - 6100 - Utilities
  - 6200 - Salaries
  - 6300 - Marketing
  - 6400 - Insurance

  2. Record Daily Transactions

  Every business transaction requires balanced debits and credits. Here are common examples:

  Example 1: Customer Payment Received ($1,000)
  DEBIT:  Cash (1000)                 $1,000
  CREDIT: Accounts Receivable (1100)  $1,000
  Meaning: Cash increases, customer debt decreases

  Example 2: Pay Rent ($2,000)
  DEBIT:  Rent Expense (6000)         $2,000
  CREDIT: Cash (1000)                 $2,000
  Meaning: Expense recorded, cash decreases

  Example 3: Make a Sale ($5,000)
  DEBIT:  Accounts Receivable (1100)  $5,000
  CREDIT: Sales Revenue (4000)        $5,000
  Meaning: Customer owes you money, revenue recorded

  Example 4: Purchase Inventory ($3,000 on credit)
  DEBIT:  Inventory (1200)            $3,000
  CREDIT: Accounts Payable (2000)     $3,000
  Meaning: Inventory increases, debt to supplier increases

  Example 5: Pay Salaries ($4,000)
  DEBIT:  Salaries Expense (6200)     $4,000
  CREDIT: Cash (1000)                 $4,000

  3. Monthly/Quarterly Reporting

  Use the Reports page to:

  Trial Balance - Verify your books are balanced (debits = credits)
  Income Statement - See profit/loss for a period (Revenue - Expenses)
  Balance Sheet - See your financial position at a point in time (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)

  The Double-Entry System Explained

  Every transaction affects two or more accounts. This ensures your books always balance.

  The Accounting Equation:
  Assets = Liabilities + Equity

  How accounts behave:
  - Assets & Expenses: DEBIT increases, CREDIT decreases
  - Liabilities, Equity & Revenue: CREDIT increases, DEBIT decreases

  Real-World Workflow Example

  Monthly routine for a small business:

  1. Daily: Record sales, expenses, payments received, bills paid
  2. Weekly: Review trial balance to catch errors early
  3. Monthly:
    - Generate income statement to see profit/loss
    - Generate balance sheet to see financial position
    - Reconcile bank statements with Cash account
  4. Quarterly/Annual: Review for tax purposes

  What This System Does Well

  ✅ Enforces accuracy - Can't create unbalanced transactions
  ✅ Complete audit trail - Every transaction tracked with date, description, reference
  ✅ Multi-client isolation - Run multiple businesses separately
  ✅ Standard reports - Trial balance, P&L, balance sheet
  ✅ Flexible chart of accounts - Customize to your business

  What You Might Add Later

  For a production business system, you might want to add:

  - Bank reconciliation feature
  - Recurring transactions (monthly rent, etc.)
  - Invoice generation and tracking
  - Multi-currency support
  - Tax calculation and reporting
  - Budget vs actual comparisons
  - Cash flow statements
  - Account editing/deactivation

  But the core architecture is perfect - it's built on solid accounting principles!
